<div  id='write'  class = 'is-mac'><p>The S&amp;P 500 Index tumbled to its lowest since July. And the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields reached their highest since 2011. </p><p>I make a excerpt of the relevant and valuable news and organize them into clear and logical form. Note all the sources are directly collected from Bloomberg and Marketwatch&#39;s free online news and do not fully represent my own perspective, yet they accord with my own <em>a priori</em> market sense. Hope it could invoke some insights behind this perplexing omen. </p><p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/164999096@N06/43442395640/in/dateposted-public/" title="stock-fall-10-08"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1903/43442395640_d953698cd4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="482" alt="stock-fall-10-08"></a></p><p><a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-10/the-markets-might-agree-with-trump-on-the-fed'>Detailed narrative</a></p><div class='md-toc' mdtype='toc'><p class="md-toc-content"><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n0"><a class="md-toc-inner" href="#header-n0">Market Meltdown on Oct 10, 2018</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h3" data-ref="n190"><a class="md-toc-inner" href="#header-n190">Plunge Explannation</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h3" data-ref="n114"><a class="md-toc-inner" href="#header-n114">Global Impact</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h3" data-ref="n180"><a class="md-toc-inner" href="#header-n180">Future Outlook</a></span></p></div><h3><a name='header-n190' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Plunge Explannation</h3><p>There are several direct reasonable <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-11/the-stock-market-meltdown-that-everyone-saw-coming'>&#39;hindsight&#39; attributions</a> (listed below), though the radical casuality is still uncertain like a random walk:</p><ul><li><p>Monetary: <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/white-house-says-economy-incredibly-strong-despite-selloff'>Fed’s tightening</a> of monetary policy</p><p>Fed is <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/fed-raises-rates-and-says-more-coming-brushing-off-trump-jabs'>raising interest rates</a> to <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/williams-says-fed-rate-hikes-helping-curb-financial-risk-taking'>curb financial risk-taking</a> </p><blockquote><p>&quot;A very-low interest-rate environment for a long time does, at least in some dimension, probably add to financial risks, or risk-taking, reach for yield, things like that.
